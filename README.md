# üìß Email Phishing Detection Using Machine Learning

## üß† Project Description
The **Email Phishing Detection System** is a machine learning-based project developed to automatically detect phishing emails. Phishing is a common cyberattack technique where attackers impersonate legitimate sources to steal sensitive information such as passwords and credit card details. This project analyzes email content and structure to classify them as **phishing** or **legitimate**, thereby enhancing cybersecurity and protecting users from online threats.


## üéØ Objective
To develop an AI-powered system that accurately detects phishing emails using machine learning algorithms by analyzing textual and structural features.



## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Automatically detects phishing and legitimate emails  
- Extracts important features from emails (URLs, sender info, keywords, etc.)  
- Uses machine learning algorithms for accurate classification  
- Provides clear output: *Phishing* or *Legitimate*  
- Easy to integrate and extend for real-world use  



## üß∞ Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, NLTK  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code  
- **Algorithms:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes  



## üß© Workflow
1. **Data Collection:** Import dataset containing phishing and legitimate emails  
2. **Preprocessing:** Clean and tokenize text, remove stopwords, and extract features  
3. **Feature Extraction:** Convert email text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer  
4. **Model Training:** Train machine learning models using extracted features  
5. **Evaluation:** Test model performance using accuracy and precision metrics  
6. **Prediction:** Classify unseen emails as *Phishing* or *Legitimate*
